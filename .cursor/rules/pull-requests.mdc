# Pull Request Description Guidelines

When generating pull request descriptions, follow these guidelines:

## Format Requirements
- Always provide output in **raw Markdown format within a code block** for easy copy-paste
- Use triple backticks with `markdown` language identifier
- Keep descriptions **minimalistic** and focused

## Content Structure
1. **Title**: Clear, action-oriented (e.g., "Replace Google Analytics with Google Tag Manager")
2. **Summary**: Brief functional overview of what changed
3. **Changes**: Bullet points of key modifications
4. **Testing**: Simple, actionable steps for verification
5. **Notes**: Any important considerations (optional)

## Target Audience
- Code reviewers who need to understand the purpose and scope
- Testing team who need verification steps
- Future developers who may reference this change

## Example Structure
```markdown
# [Action] [Component/Feature]

## Summary
Brief description of functional changes and why they were made.

## Changes
- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2

## Testing
1. Step to verify change
2. Expected behavior

## Notes (if needed)

```

## Key Principles
- **Concise over comprehensive** - focus on essential information
- **Actionable testing steps** - clear verification instructions  
- **Functional focus** - what changed and why, not implementation details
- **Copy-paste ready** - proper formatting for immediate use
