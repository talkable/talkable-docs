Integration
===========

.. important::
   Before integrating SDK campaigns into your app, make sure you have campaigns properly configured 
   in Talkable. See :ref:`SDK Campaign Setup <campaigns/tutorials/sdk_campaign_setup>` for complete 
   campaign setup guide including tags, native sharing, and mobile optimization.

The SDK is installed and configured. Now you can integrate Standalone and/or Post Purchase campaigns into your mobile app.

- :ref:`Custom Events <ios_sdk/integration/event>`
