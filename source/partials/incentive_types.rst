* **rebate** — monetary reward, certain amount of money that should be paid out
  to a customer with a given email. Payment should be handled by the merchants'
  payment systems.
* **discount_coupon** — discount coupon is issued to customer. This type of
  incentives is handled by Talkable.
* **other** — used when a campaign has a non-monetary rebate like *"Free T-shirt"*
  or *"One Month Free"*. This should be handled on the merchant’s side. More
