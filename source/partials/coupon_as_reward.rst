   <h2>Coupon codes as a reward</h2>

.. important::

   If referral campaigns are set-up to reward either Friends or Advocates with
   Talkable provided coupon codes, then the Reward Webhook is called for
   informational purposes only. It is a notification that the reward has been
   provided. Note, Talkable gets these coupons either by manual upload from the
   Dashboard, or if configured, Talkable will call the  :ref:`Create Coupon
   Webhook <web_hooks/create_coupon>` to generate additional coupons
   automatically.
