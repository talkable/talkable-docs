   :description: Synchronize customer loyalty data from Yotpo Loyalty & Referrals platform with Talkable integration.

Yotpo
=====

Loyalty & Referrals
-------------------

Yotpo Loyalty & Referrals is a comprehensive customer loyalty platform that helps businesses create loyalty programs with points and rewards, manage VIP tiers, and track customer engagement.

The Talkable integration with Yotpo allows you to **leverage customer loyalty data to create personalized referral experiences** for your most valuable customers. The saved Yotpo loyalty data can be found in their custom properties.

Integration with Yotpo is done in Talkable with the corresponding App Store application.

This integration synchronizes data **FROM Yotpo TO Talkable**. It supports the following data to be synchronized:

* Customer loyalty points balance
* VIP tier status (Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.)
* Tier change notifications (gained or lost status)

.. note::

  This is a **pull-only integration** - Talkable receives loyalty data from Yotpo but does not send any data back to Yotpo.

Here are the conditions when Talkable receives loyalty data:

1. Customer's loyalty points balance changes in Yotpo
2. Customer gains a VIP tier status in Yotpo
3. Customer loses a VIP tier status in Yotpo

The integration uses webhooks to automatically sync this data in real-time, ensuring your Talkable campaigns always have the most up-to-date loyalty information.

Integration Setup
-----------------

Yotpo Points in Talkable Wallet
...............................

You can use Yotpo custom properties to display customer's loyalty points alongside their referral rewards directly in the Talkable Wallet.  
This gives customers a unified view of both referral and loyalty activity in one place.

In the example below, we'll show how to display the customer's Yotpo points balance in the header of the Apple Wallet pass:

1. Navigate to the **Editor** of the desired campaign:

   .. image:: /_static/img/email_marketing_and_automation/yotpo_wallet_editor.png

3. Update the **Apple Wallet header field label** localization with **REFERRALS | POINTS**, and set the **Apple Wallet header field value** to the following code:
   
   .. code-block:: liquid
      :force:

      {{ referrals_count_by_status.total | default: 0 }} | {{  custom_properties.yotpo.point_balance | default: 0 }}

4. In the preview, you'll see that the wallet header now displays Points in addition to Referrals:
