2. Promote refer-a-friend to your SMS list to facilitate increased sharing. Mobile messages have a 99% open rate.

  **Sample SMS triggered post-purchase:**

  Thanks for your recent purchase! A referral from you would mean a lot to us! Share â€˜Brand nameâ€™ with friends & weâ€™ll share $10 with you ðŸ˜ƒ

3. Trigger referral messages through SMS for increased engagement.

  For example, send advocates their referral reward via text to increase redemptions and repeat shoppers.
