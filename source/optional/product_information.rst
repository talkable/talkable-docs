Product Information Integration (Optional)
==========================================

You can also add product specific tracking to Curebit, which will let your
customers share specific items that they've purchased. Customer shares with
products have higher click through and conversion rates.

To integrate products with Curebit, you will add an additional script include
and call at the bottom of your checkout page. The parameters should be replaced
accordingly with your products' information.
