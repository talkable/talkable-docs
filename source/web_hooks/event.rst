Event Webhook
=============

The Talkable Event Webhook notifies your endpoint that an :ref:`Event <advanced_features/events>`
or a :ref:`Purchase <integration/standard/integration_components/post_purchase_script>` has been
registered with Talkable.

Use cases for the Event Webhook include:

* Capturing purchases and custom referral events generated by the customer (e.g. added data to profile or renewed a subscription)
* Tracking coupon codes used for purchases
* Using Talkable events to trigger custom workflows (e.g. add a custom property to a customer who just cancelled a subscription)

or using the :ref:`Talkable backend API <api_v2/origins>`.
