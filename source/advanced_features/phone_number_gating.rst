Phone number gating
===================

Phone number feature allows you to collect customers' phone numbers inside your campaigns and use them for promotions.

You can set the phone number as a required field for customers to join the campaign or get a reward.
Setting can be found inside ``Campaign → Rules → Extra section`` for both Advocate and Friend.

.. note::

  Currently, phone number gating can be enabled only with enabled email gating.

Inside the campaign, you can change the default setting for the consent checkbox.

You can configure App store apps to send opt-ins with a customer’s phone number.
Currently, a phone number can be used for the next apps:

* :ref:`Attentive <email_marketing_and_automation/attentive>`
* :ref:`Bronto <email_marketing_and_automation/oracle_bronto>`
* :ref:`Klaviyo <email_marketing_and_automation/klaviyo>`
* :ref:`HubSpot <email_marketing_and_automation/hubspot>`
