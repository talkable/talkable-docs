Including Product Items
=======================

You can also add product specific tracking to Talkable
which will let your customers share specific items that they’ve purchased.
Customer shares with products have higher click through and conversion rates.

.. include:: /partials/product_purchase_script.rst

.. note::

  All product items are included into Purchase details inside Purchases report.
  This information is helpful for debugging.
