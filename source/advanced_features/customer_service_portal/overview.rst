Navigating to the Customer Service Portal
-----------------------------------------

The Customer Service Portal provides a simple search box that will allow you to search by several criteria:

- **Email**: the email of the user.
- **Phone number**: the phone number of the user. The search value should include a country code.
  If no county code is given, Talkable will try applying the USA and Canada codes and search with the resulting number.
- **Order number**: the order number of a purchase.
- **Coupon code**: the single-use coupon code issued as a reward to a referral program user.
- **Personal coupon code**: the :ref:`personal coupon code <advanced_features/personal_coupon_sharing>`, shared by an Advocate.

The search query might produce multiple results. In such case, every matched user will be listed,
showing some personal info (email and phone number) and, if present, other matched fields (i.e., order number and/or coupon code).
To see more personal details, select a user from the list.
