Creating the referral
---------------------

Now that you know the Advocate and a campaign they have participated in, you are now able to create a referral
with this information:

1. Visit “Create referral” section.
2. Paste Advocate email into the “Advocate’s email” field.
3. Provide some valid order subtotal (there is a chance the reward may be blocked due to low subtotal amount,
   you can either set it pretty high or check Campaign Rules → Incentives → Advocate referral incentive
   criteria beforehand).
4. Choose the campaign. You can paste its name from the step 6.1 in the campaigns search bar and the requested
   campaign will appear immediately.
5. Press “Create Referral” button.
