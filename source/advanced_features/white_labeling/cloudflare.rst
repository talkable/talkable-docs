Adding DNS records in Cloudflare
================================

.. note::

   The instructions below use `subdomain.example.com` as an example of a custom domain where `example.com` is your domain.

`Cloudflare docs <https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records>`_

#. In your Cloudflare dashboard, select the site you want to manage in **Websites** (e.g. `example.com`).

#. Go to **DNS** â†’ **Records** and click "Add record".

#. Select appropriate record type (might be `NS`, `CNAME`, `MX`, etc.).

#. In the "Name" field, enter only the **subdomain** part
   (e.g. `subdomain` if you want to add a record for `subdomain.example.com`).

#. Copy the DNS record value from the Talkable custom domain settings into the "Value" field.
   Note: Unlike some other platforms, Cloudfront does not allow multiple values in NS record.
   Instead, you'll need to add multiple NS records with the same name and different values.
