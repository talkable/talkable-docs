UTM Tags
===========================

UTM tags are essential for tracking the performance of marketing campaigns across various

    - Medium (utm_medium): Specifies the marketing medium, such as email, social, or CPC (Cost Per Click).
    - Campaign (utm_campaign): Specifies the name of the marketing campaign.
    - Term (utm_term): Used for paid search keywords.
    - Content (utm_content): Used to differentiate similar content, such as different versions of an ad.

Example of usage:
 Add to your page link UTM parameters:
 ``/friends?refer=friends&utm_source=example_source&utm_medium=example_medium``
