Integration with Third Party Deep Linking Services
==================================================

Talkable can work with third party deep linking providers such as GetSocial,
Branch.io, and Firebase. Talkable is able to use deep linking functionality to
track app installations and reward your Advocates and Friends for installing your
mobile app on their phones.

Deep linking services provide a special referral link that can be given to
Advocates to be shared with their Friends. Once opened on a Friend's mobile
device, this link will not only redirect them to the App Store to install the app,
but also track that the app was installed using a referral link. Deep linking can
also be used to send a Friend to a specific place in the app once it's installed
and opened for the first time, show them personalized messages, and more.

1. Configure your Talkable campaign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use deep linking with Talkable campaigns, simply use your deep link URL as your Talkable Site URL.

.. note::

   If you have configured a custom Friend Destination URL for your campaign,
   make sure the following GET parameters are present in the final URL:
   ``?tkbl_cvuuid={{ visitor_uuid }}&talkable_visitor_offer_id={{ friend_offer.id }}``.

   All major deep linking providers support passing additional GET parameters
   with the deep link. This functionality is used to pass the Friend's identifying
   information to the Talkable SDK in your iOS app. To use this functionality with
   Firebase, refer to this document: `Manually constructing a Dynamic Link URL`_.

2. Pass deep linking params to the Talkable SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Retrieve deep linking params as described in your deep linking provider's
documentation and pass these params to the Talkable SDK using the
``TalkableDeepLinking.track()`` method. This method accepts a single argument of
following types:

* ``JSONObject`` (Branch.io)
* ``Map<String, String>`` (GetSocial)
* ``android.net.Uri`` (Firebase)
* ``android.app.Activity`` (native deep linking)

.. code-block:: java

   // For Branch.io

   Branch.getInstance().initSession(new Branch.BranchReferralInitListener() {
       @Override
       public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {
           TalkableDeepLinking.track(referringParams);
       }
   }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);

.. note::

   Most deep linking services provide additional parameters in the deep link
   handler to indicate whether the app was installed on this device for the first
   time, reinstalled or simply launched. You can use these params to register
   installs only when desired conditions are met.

.. code-block:: java

   // For GetSocial

   GetSocial.getReferralData(new FetchReferralDataCallback() {
       @Override
       public void onSuccess(@Nullable ReferralData referralData) {
           if (referralData != null && referralData.isFirstMatch()) {
               TalkableDeepLinking.track(referralData.getLinkParams().getStringValues());
           }
       }

       @Override
       public void onFailure(GetSocialException error) {}
   }

.. code-block:: java

   // For Firebase

   FirebaseDynamicLinks.getInstance()
       .getDynamicLink(getIntent())
       .addOnSuccessListener(this, new OnSuccessListener<PendingDynamicLinkData>() {
           @Override
           public void onSuccess(PendingDynamicLinkData pendingDynamicLinkData) {
               // Get deep link from result (may be null if no link is found)
               Uri deepLink = null;
               if (pendingDynamicLinkData != null) {
                   deepLink = pendingDynamicLinkData.getLink();
               }

               if (deepLink != null) {
                   TalkableDeepLinking.track(deepLink);
               }
           }
       })

Calling the ``TalkableDeepLinking.track()`` method will register the app
installation event in Talkable and complete the referral cycle.
You can then use the :ref:`TalkableApi.retrieveRewards() <android_sdk/api>`
method to check for rewards.
