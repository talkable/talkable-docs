   :description: Learn how to integrate Talkable's referral program with your Tapcart mobile app.

Tapcart
==================

Overview
--------

The integration with Tapcart enables mobile app-based referral programs that leverage contact sharing to drive customer acquisition. This powerful combination allows your customers to easily share referral codes through their preferred communication channels, including SMS and social platforms.

Through Tapcart's Contact Sharing feature, you can integrate with referral code-based services like Talkable. Contact Sharing incentivizes consumers (via gift cards or discounts) to share referral-based offerings through their preferred social platform or directly with SMS contacts on their device. The integration focuses on utilizing key elements of social proof to increase consumer engagement and spending with your brand.

Requirements
------------

* Tapcart Enterprise subscription
* Talkable Enterprise account
* Valid API credentials from Talkable

-----------------

Follow these steps to configure the integration:

1. Access Integration Settings
   
   * Navigate to your Tapcart Dashboard
