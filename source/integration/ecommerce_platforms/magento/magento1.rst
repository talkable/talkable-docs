Magento 1.x Integration
=======================
.. warning::

   Magento 1 is not supported from July 1st, 2020.

.. note::

   You must have Talkable account in order to get started

A `Magento Talkable extension`_ is available for easy
integration. The extension currently supports Magento versions 1.5+

1. Since Magento 1 reached EOL and Magento 1 extensions were removed from the
   Magento Marketplace, you’re only able to download them manually via SSH / FTP.

2. After the extension has been installed, you must enable the extension and set
   your Talkable Site ID. Click the **Return to Admin** link and navigate to
   **System** → **Configuration**:

   Note: If you have more than one store, set the **Current Configuration Scope**
   on the top left to the store you want to enable Talkable on. Note this must be
   a Magento "Website", not a "Store view".

3. In the left sidebar navigation click on **Talkable** → **Extension Options** tab:

   inside Talkable, or on your Talkable Site Dashboard:
