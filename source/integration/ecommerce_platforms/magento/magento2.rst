Configuring Talkable Extension
------------------------------

The extension configuration screen consists of three sections: Integration_, Campaigns_ and `Page URLs`_.

Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Integration section allows you to change the Talkable Site ID, which is used to connect your store
to your Talkable account.

   .. image:: /_static/img/magento2/configure2.jpg

.. warning::

   Only change this setting if you need to connect your store to a different site in the Talkable dashboard.
   An incorrect value will prevent your campaigns from showing.

   Changing the Site ID will invalidate the full page cache. Magento will display a warning message with
   a link to the Cache Management page. Please follow this link and refresh the invalidated cache types.

.. note::

   If you have activated the extension's integration, the Site ID will be prefilled
   (see `Activating the Integration`_). If you chose not to activate the integration,
   you need to paste the Site ID from your Talkable Site Dashboard into this field.

Campaigns
~~~~~~~~~

The Campaigns section allows you to enable or disable different types of campaigns on your site.
For example, if you don’t have Standalone or Advocate Dashboard campaigns configured in Talkable,
you can disable these campaigns in extension config, so the corresponding pages are not accessible.

|page_break|

Page URLs
~~~~~~~~~

The Page URLs section allows you to change paths to the Standalone Share and Advocate Dashboard pages.
The paths must match the placements you have configured in Talkable for this campaign type.
Default values correspond to default placements in Talkable.

.. image:: /_static/img/magento2/configure5.jpg

.. warning::

   Only change these settings if you have configured custom placements for these campaign types
   in your Talkable dashboard. Incorrect values will prevent your Standalone or Dashboard campaign from showing.
