  :description: Push data to Microsoft Dynamics CRM and sync status changes from Microsoft Dynamics to Talkable.

Microsoft Dynamics CRM Integration
==================================

With this integration, Talkable pushes relevant customer data to Microsoft Dynamics CRM and synchronizes status changes back to Talkable.

**How it works**

- **Data Push**: Customer data collected through Talkable is automatically pushed to Microsoft Dynamics CRM, ensuring your CRM contains the latest information.
- **Status Sync**: Any status changes made in Microsoft Dynamics CRM are synced back to Talkable, ensuring your campaigns are always up to date.
