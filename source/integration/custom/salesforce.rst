Salesforce Integration
======================

With this integration, Talkable pushes relevant customer data to Salesforce and synchronizes status changes back to Talkable.

**How it works**

- **Data Push**: Customer data collected through Talkable is automatically pushed to Salesforce, ensuring your CRM has the latest information.
- **Status Sync**: Any status changes made in Salesforce are synced back to Talkable, keeping your marketing campaigns up to date.
