Integration Components
======================

Talkable Loyalty is composed of the following components:

1. `Initialization Script <Initialization Script_>`_

   **Script Location.** The Initialization script should be placed in the head template or some template
   that spans every page. All other integration components are dependent on the Init script.

   **Data Capture.** The Initialization Script should pass variables for logged in users:

    - Email
    - Phone Number

2. :ref:`Loyalty Dashboard`

3. :ref:`Loyalty Redeem Widget`

4. :ref:`Loyalty Actions`

.. _integration/loyalty/integration_components/initialization_script:

Initialization Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Initialization script should be placed in the head template or some
template that spans every page. Talkable JS library size is typically
around 20kB and causes no noticeable impact to your siteâ€™s loading time.
All other integration components are dependent on the Initialization
script.

.. code-block:: html

   <!-- Begin Talkable integration code -->
   <script async src="https://d2jjzw81hqbuqv.cloudfront.net/integration/clients/<YOUR-TALKABLE-SITE-ID>.min.js"></script>
   <script>
     window._talkableq = window._talkableq || [];
     window._talkableq.unshift(['init', { site_id: '<YOUR-TALKABLE-SITE-ID>' }]);

     window._talkableq.push(['authenticate_customer', {
       email: '', // required, loyalty program is only available to logged in users. Example: 'customer@example.com'
       phone_number: '' // Optional, pass when available. Example: '+12025551111'
     }]);
   </script>
   <!-- End Talkable integration code -->

Initialization Script Notes
---------------------------

1. **Site ID.** You can obtain your Site ID by logging into the Talkable
   platform where Site ID is displayed on your Dashboard and URL as seen
   here:

   .. figure:: /_static/img/site_id.png
      :alt: Site ID

2. **Variables.** Use your dynamic variables to pass user details.

.. _Loyalty Dashboard:

Loyalty Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the following Talkable Container DIV in the body of every page that has `Talkable Initialization Script <Initialization Script_>`_ included:

.. code-block:: html

   <div id="talkable-loyalty"></div>

Loyalty Dashboard Notes
-----------------------

1. The `Talkable Initialization Script <Initialization Script_>`_ must be
   present in your head template in order for the Loyalty Dashboard to work.

2. The dashboard can be added inline inside your user accounts menu, however
   the dashboard content width for proper display is 980px.

3. Allow your users to reach the Loyalty Dashboard by adding a link
   from any place that makes sense considering your website configuration.
   Most common uses are links in the user accounts section, or from the user accounts menu.

.. _Loyalty Redeem Widget:

Loyalty Redeem Widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same as `Loyalty Dashboard <Loyalty Dashboard_>`_.

.. _Loyalty Actions:

Loyalty Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To register custom loyalty actions (e.g. completing surveys, adding reviews, uploading something on site),
use the following code:

.. code-block:: html

   <script>
     window._talkableq.push(['register_loyalty_action', {
       rule_identifier: '', // required, can be found in Campaign Rules -> Loyalty action configurations -> "identifier" field
       traffic_source: '' // optional
     }]);
   </script>

Loyalty Actions Notes
---------------------

1. `register_loyalty_action` optionally accepts `email` and `custom_properties`. If none provided, values will be
   taken from respective parameters of `authenticate_customer`. Email must be provided in either of the sources to
   register loyalty actions.
