Friend Reward Paid Email
------------------------

Main purpose of this email is to send a Reward via email, and remind about
it in the future. |br|
Email is triggered to a |friend| who passed Email Gating, and received Reward
(i.e. coupon code). |br|

The email will be sent once Talkable knows Friend’s email which they provides on the Friend Claim Page (such technique works great for email capturing). See :ref:`tutorials_email_gating` for more details.

Frequently used Variables:

- Main |cta| should point to a merchant site to start shopping
  ``{{ proceed_to_merchant_path }}``.
- To show coupon code use ``{{ coupon_code }}``.
- To show expiration date use ``{{ valid_until }}``.

- The Email **will not** be sent only if all three conditions meet:
