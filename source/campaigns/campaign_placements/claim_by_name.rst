  :description: Claim by Name campaign appears from the corner of a page showing call-to-action messages to your customers. And it all happens smoothly.

Claim by Name Placement
=======================

Given a referral campaign with personal name sharing channel enabled, advocates can simply share their names
to engage friends in the referral program. The friends then should visit the page with a Claim by Name campaign
to see the widget that shows a call to action message, ex. “Have been referred by a friend?”.
Clicking on it expands the widget in a pop-up, allowing the visitor to enter their email and
their friend's personal name to claim their reward.
