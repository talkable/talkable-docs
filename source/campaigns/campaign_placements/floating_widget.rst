   :description: Floating Widget appears from the corner of each page showing call-to-action messages to your customers. And it all happens smoothly.

Floating Widget Placement
=========================

You can create Campaigns of different types (Invite, Dashboard, Leaderboard, etc) and show them as
the eye-catching Floating Widget in the corner of each page of your site. Widget shows a call to action message, ex.
“Get $10 for Sharing”, to all your visitors. Clicking on it expands the selected Campaign in a pop-up.

Integration instructions
------------------------

Floating Widget Placement doesn’t require any additional integration.
If you have already added Talkable to your main layout (completed General Integration
for Custom platform, or installed Shopify, Magento, or Salesforce Commerce Cloud extensions), then you are all done.
|br|
**Note:** For Magento site just make sure the Floating Widget Popup is enabled in the Talkable extension settings in your Magento Admin Panel.
|br|
|br|
Go ahead and create your Floating Widget Campaign. Once it is launched your customers will see
the Campaign on all pages of your site.
