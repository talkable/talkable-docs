Loyalty Widget Placement
===============

Once you have your Loyalty Campaigns set up, you can use this placement to show your customers a widget that will allow them to convert their points into a coupon which they can use on the checkout page.

.. note::
   If a customer is not signed in, the widget promts them to join the loyalty program.

It is a good practice is to show this widget when your customers are about to check out.

------------------------

Loyalty Widget Placement doesnâ€™t require any additional integration.

for Custom platform, or installed Shopify, Magento, or Salesforce Commerce Cloud extensions), then you are all done.
