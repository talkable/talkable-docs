   :description: Loyalty Widget Placement is a Placement for Loyalty Campaigns.

Loyalty Widget Placement
========================

Once you have your Loyalty Campaigns set up, you can use this placement to show your customers a widget that will allow them to convert their points into a coupon which they can use on the checkout page.

.. note::
   If a customer is not signed in, the widget promts them to join the loyalty program and provide the email manually.

It is a good practice to show this widget when your customers are about to check out so that they are able to convert their points to a coupon and apply it on the purchase.

Integration instructions
------------------------

Loyalty Widget Placement doesnâ€™t require any additional integration since integration `5.0.0`.
If you have already added Talkable to your main layout (completed General Integration
for Custom platform, or installed Shopify, Magento, or Salesforce Commerce Cloud extensions), then you are all done.
