Campaign Types
==============

Encourage customers to share with their friends from anywhere on your site.

Invite
------

Invite campaigns allow site visitors to share with their friends from anywhere
on your site. Invite campaigns are both powerful and versatile. Multiple Invite
campaigns can be run simultaneously for maximum results.

Advocate Dashboard
------------------

The Advocate Dashboard allows the Advocate to see a complete overview of their
shares and rewards. Seeing an overview of their activity makes Advocates more
motivated to share. Advocate Dashboards also reduce Customer Service inquiries
as customers can see statuses directly from the dashboard.

Reward Gleam
------------

A Reward Gleam improves the on-site conversion rate by assisting Friends and
Advocates in using their coupons to purchase. When the Friend or Advocate
receives a reward and visits your website the coupon code is captured. The code
will be highlighted in the Reward Gleam at the bottom of the page.

Leaderboard
-----------

A Leaderboard turns referrals into a competition. Advocates are ranked on a
Leaderboard page based on the number of successful referrals. After an allotted
time period, top performers can be identified and rewarded with a grand prize.

Tiered Rewards
--------------

A Tiered Rewards campaign incentivizes Advocates to share with multiple friends
as they are rewarded for subsequent successful referrals. By setting reward
goals for Advocates, they are more likely to increase their share rate.
