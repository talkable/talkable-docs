Incentive Criteria
------------------

When you create an incentive for |advocate| or |friend|, you can set its trigger condition.

Condition is processed by |liquid| and the result should evaluate to ``true``
for incentive to be triggered.

If condition is left blank, it is assumed to be ``true``.

   <h4>Example</h4>

If you want to reward |advocate| only if |friend| is a new customer and used |br|
Talkable single-use coupon at checkout, the right trigger condition would be:

If condition evaluates to anything else than ``true`` or ``false``, the value
it returns will be visible in Referrals Report.

This way, you can know which part of a condition was the reason |advocate| didn’t
get a reward:
